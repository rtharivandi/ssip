Stupidly Simple Image Program

Right now it only does one thing, which is make a slideshow out of different folders.
I could probably implement more features in the future, such as simple editing of the pictures, downloading pictures directly from profiles, etc.

This is currently my first Java project I actually put time into. 

P.S. This is much more fun than doing Leetcodes istg
