# SSIP
A **S**tupidly **S**imple **I**mage **P**rogram written in Java.

I really like watching slideshows, sometimes I just let one play on my other monitor while I'm working on something else. There were many times where I thought to myself, "Hm, why doesn't any image program do this ***insert super specific thing***?"

So I just thought, "Hey, I know Java. I'll make one on my own then." And so I made this program for myself and anyone else looking for a slideshow program that does the things I'll list below.

Also, so that I'd have some kind of project on my CV.

# Features
So why would anyone use this program instead of just clicking the "Slideshow" button on their image program?
I've added a couple of cool features into SSIP. Features that no other programs I know have! Please check them out!

## Slideshow from multiple folders
You can make a slideshow from multiple folders instead of just one. Just add another folder (or images) you want, you'll have it on the slideshow! 

## Random Slideshow
Let the program surprise you which image comes next.

## Shuffle
Let's say you've added multiple folders, and then you'd like to see one pic from one folder, then one from the next, and then another one from the next.
You get the point. Just click on the "Shuffle" button, and you can either navigate through the slideshow yourself, or let the program do the work (just click play)!

# Upcoming Features
Some other features I'm either developing or planning to.
You know what they say, a software will never be finished. It will always get maintained and get new features added to it.


## Order your own slideshow
You want this one image to go before that other one? You can now. Go crazy.
